### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?

-DriverPass was our new client and a driving school that recently wanted to start hosting an online application and a website 
that lets students take practice lessons and exams. I've successfully implemented some of the newest cutting-edge
technology and expertise to boost customer expereicen such as AWS, cross-platform compatibility and off-line features etc. 

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
-Although I put my 100% of myself into this project, probably I could have brushed up my skills on creating some of the diagrams. 
As for some of the disgrams, it was my virgin experience to take on with lucidchart so it was also a bit challening for me. 


### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider 
the user’s needs when designing?

-I strongly felt their desparate needs for starting an online platform ASAP... This was due to the recent covid pandemic situation 
that completely deprived their on-campus students and they had urgent needs to shifting their school environtment into the online platform
in order to sustain their entity. I have carefully crafted the system so that the student wouldn't miss out or
feel any of differences by taking their online course by virtually enable them to do everything online (and off-line). 

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

-My motto is that by choosing the best option, the one should benefit the most. What I mean the options is by that by knowing and utilizing the 
newest technology and norms. Some of my clients' website run at merely $.50 per month thanks to the low cost of S3 bucket by AWS. 
And the physical infrastructure, data center is no longer our concern to deal with thanks to the AWS. I approached to DriverPass's 
case to achieve the best performance, best scalability, and best user-friendly solutions at the lowest possible cost. 
Right now, we are planning to implement some online survey to collect the customer experience satisfactory metrics.
We will also occasionally start some of them longer versions of survey which will present $25 Amazon giftcard to the selected contributors.
